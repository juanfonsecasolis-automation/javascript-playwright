Good programming language choices for end-to-end test automation seem to satisfy the following conditions: (i) be an scripting language, to do more with less lines of code and support larger applications (as in enterprise software vs. system software), (ii) have an easy-to-understand syntax, to let non-developers team members participate in the automation process (think on manual testers without a programming background), (iii) be an object-oriented programming language (OOPL), to implement Page Object Model (POM) and facilitate maintenability of the project, and (iv) be compatible with Selenium WebDriver (a long-standing test tool well adapted to the industry) [2]. Javascript (JS) satisfies conditions i and iv, but not ii and iii, as it overuses code nesting (code inside brackets), await-asyncs, and it is not a fully OOPL [4, 5]. TypeScript (TS), a super version of Javascript, is compiled (violating i) and still not fully an OOPL [6, 7]. Python and Ruby are better choices according to the conditions mentioned, but I still plan to investigate automation with JS/TS to obtain a better understanding.
